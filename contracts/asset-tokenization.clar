;; title: Real-World Asset Tokenization Contract
;; summary: Implements fractionalized ownership of real-world assets with compliance features.
;; description: This contract allows for the creation, management, and transfer of tokenized real-world assets. It includes features for fractional ownership, compliance checks, and administrative controls to ensure regulatory adherence.
